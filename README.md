# FACE-RECOGNITION

The face recognition library of python is built with inbuilt trained HOG and CNN (Resnet) Model that can identify human faces.

**Face Encodings:**
        
We can pass a human face image to the functions of the  library to
   * find out Facial encodings i.e. features like eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc that depicts a human face.
   * find out the location of the face in the image and return the co-ordinate list which can be used for drawing a bounding box.
   * find out the percentage of match between 2 faces using the encoded values.
There are many more functions we can explore.


**Face Classification:**

If we create a dataset of human faces with their name as Filenames, Face_recognition library can be used to compare the real - time captured face to a present dataset to find out the person.
